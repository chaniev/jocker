## Placement Conventions

- Scene classes are placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/`.
- Scene coordinators are placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Coordinator/`.
- SpriteKit node classes are placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Nodes/`.
- Game services are grouped by responsibility in `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/AI/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/Flow/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/History/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/Settings/`, and `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/Statistics/`.
- Domain and state models are grouped in `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Bot/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Cards/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Gameplay/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/History/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Joker/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Players/`, and `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Statistics/`.
- Scoring logic is placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Scoring/`.
- UIKit controllers and views are grouped by flow in `Jocker/Jocker/ViewControllers/Bidding/`, `Jocker/Jocker/ViewControllers/GameFlow/`, `Jocker/Jocker/ViewControllers/Results/`, and `Jocker/Jocker/ViewControllers/Statistics/`.
- Shared AI test builders and service fixtures live in `Jocker/JockerTests/Bot/` next to the bot service regression suites they support.
- Unit tests are grouped by feature under `Jocker/JockerTests/` subfolders.
- Xcode Project Navigator groups under `Models/`, `Game/Services/`, `ViewControllers/`, and `JockerTests/` should mirror these filesystem subfolders 1:1.
- Shared core primitives are placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Core/`.
- Resource files (`.sks`, assets, storyboards) stay under `Jocker/Jocker/Resources/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Assets.xcassets/`, and `Jocker/Jocker/Base.lproj/`.
- Developer automation scripts are placed in `scripts/` at repository root.

## Type/File Rule

- For new entities, keep one top-level type per file and match file name to type name.
