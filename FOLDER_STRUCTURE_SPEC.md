## Key File Responsibilities

- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameScene.swift`: base gameplay scene shell (scene lifecycle, table/player/UI setup, shared layout helpers, top-level touch routing, and orchestration over extracted scene session/presentation/persistence helpers).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameSceneInputConfiguration.swift`: explicit external setup configuration for `GameScene` (player count/names/control modes/bot difficulty settings) applied before scene presentation.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameSceneLayoutResolver.swift`: pure geometry helper for `GameScene` (player seats, table-centered controls, bid-info sizing, trump/joker overlays, and first-dealer announcement layout).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameSceneNodeFactory.swift`: small SpriteKit node factory for `GameScene` reusable node setup (poker table and primary action buttons) so construction details do not live inline in scene orchestration.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameSceneSessionState.swift`: transient scene-owned runtime/session state (pending bids/blind selections, result-presentation flags, export markers, and did-deal markers) separated from domain game state.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameSceneInteractionBlockers.swift`: `OptionSet` for centralized interaction-blocking flags used by `GameScene` flow and modal gating.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameSceneInteractionState.swift`: explicit high-level interaction state (primary flow + pending modal) derived from blockers, used for safer `GameScene` flow-state reasoning and conflict assertions.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameSceneInteractionTransitionPolicy.swift`: pure blocker transition policy for setting/clearing high-level flow and pending-modal states while preserving unrelated blocker groups.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameScene+DealingFlow.swift`: dealing pipeline for each round (deck reset/shuffle, pre-deal blind step, staged dealing, and dealer-left trump choice stage).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameScene+BiddingFlow.swift`: bidding pipeline (bidding order, human/bot bid progression, dealer forbidden-bid rule, and bidding-to-playing transition).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameScene+PlayingFlow.swift`: trick-playing pipeline (tap hit-testing, bot autoplay scheduling, card placement, trick resolution, and trick-win registration).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/GameScene+ModalFlow.swift`: unified overlay-modal entrypoints and callbacks for trump selection, bid/blind input, joker play-mode decision fallback, and delegation into scene presentation/persistence coordinators.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Coordinator/GameSceneCoordinator.swift`: facade over round/turn/animation services; keeps scene logic thin and serializes trick resolution.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Coordinator/GameEnvironment.swift`: dependency container for `GameScene` infrastructure/services (coordinator, stores/export, and bot service factories), enabling explicit DI at scene creation.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Coordinator/GameSceneModalPresenter.swift`: UIKit modal presenter/navigation helper for `GameScene`, encapsulating root/top controller traversal and dismiss-to-start-screen behavior outside scene logic.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Coordinator/GameResultsPersistenceCoordinator.swift`: post-game persistence/export coordinator for `GameScene`, applying statistics saving and deal-history export rules against extracted session state.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Coordinator/DealHistoryPresentationCoordinator.swift`: presents deal-history details or a missing-history alert from score-table navigation without embedding UIKit routing into `GameScene`.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/Flow/GameRoundService.swift`: transitions between rounds/blocks, one-time block finalization recording, and score-manager recording via shared round-result snapshots.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/Flow/GameTurnService.swift`: entrypoint for automatic bot turn decision and trick winner resolution.
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/AI/BotMatchContextBuilder.swift`: pure builder mapping `GameState` + `ScoreManager` to `BotMatchContext` (premium snapshot + opponent model), keeping `GameScene` UI-focused.

- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/AI/BotTurnCandidateEvaluatorService.swift`: runtime evaluator loop for bot turns (candidate enumeration, heuristic scoring, round projections, and best-move selection).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/AI/BotTurnCandidateRankingService.swift`: runtime candidate-ranking helper for bot turns (utility calculation and deterministic tie-break policy).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/AI/BotTurnCardHeuristicsService.swift`: low-level runtime card/trick heuristics for bot turns (joker decision variants, threat scoring, unseen-card modeling, and immediate trick-win probability).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/AI/BotTurnRoundProjectionService.swift`: runtime round projection helper for bot turns (bid normalization, future trick estimates, expected round score, and remaining-hand projection).
- `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/AI/BotTuning+SelfPlayEvolution.swift`: thin `BotTuning` adapter over self-play evolution/head-to-head APIs (typealiases + forwarding methods), compiled in `JockerSelfPlayTools` (not in runtime app target).

## Placement Conventions

- Scene classes are placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Scenes/`.
- Scene coordinators are placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Coordinator/`.
- SpriteKit node classes are placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Nodes/`.
- Game services are grouped by responsibility in `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/AI/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/Flow/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/History/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/Settings/`, and `Jocker/Jocker/Game/Services/Statistics/`.
- Domain and state models are grouped in `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Bot/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Cards/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Gameplay/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/History/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Joker/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Players/`, and `Jocker/Jocker/Models/Statistics/`.
- Scoring logic is placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Scoring/`.
- UIKit controllers and views are grouped by flow in `Jocker/Jocker/ViewControllers/Bidding/`, `Jocker/Jocker/ViewControllers/GameFlow/`, `Jocker/Jocker/ViewControllers/Results/`, and `Jocker/Jocker/ViewControllers/Statistics/`.
- Unit tests are grouped by feature under `Jocker/JockerTests/` subfolders.
- Xcode Project Navigator groups under `Models/`, `Game/Services/`, `ViewControllers/`, and `JockerTests/` should mirror these filesystem subfolders 1:1.
- Shared core primitives are placed in `Jocker/Jocker/Core/`.
- Resource files (`.sks`, assets, storyboards) stay under `Jocker/Jocker/Resources/`, `Jocker/Jocker/Assets.xcassets/`, and `Jocker/Jocker/Base.lproj/`.
- Developer automation scripts are placed in `scripts/` at repository root.

## Type/File Rule

- For new entities, keep one top-level type per file and match file name to type name.
