# Codex Project Rules (Repo-wide)

## File and structure rules
- When creating a new class, enum, or interface, create a new file with a name that matches the type name.
- Use `FOLDER_STRUCTURE_SPEC.md` as the source of truth for project structure, file placement, and folder conventions.
- After changes that affect structure (new/moved/renamed files, new folders/groups, ownership/placement conventions), update `FOLDER_STRUCTURE_SPEC.md` to keep it accurate.

## Development process
- Use Git branching and code review practices.
- Use CI/CD when applicable.
- Keep documentation up to date.
- Maintain unit test coverage.
