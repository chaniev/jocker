- When creating a new class, enum, or interface, create a new file with a name that matches the name of the class, enum, or interface
- Use `FOLDER_STRUCTURE_SPEC.md` as the source of truth when analyzing or planning changes that touch project structure, file placement, or folder conventions
- After code changes that affect structure (new/moved/renamed files, new folders/groups, changes in ownership/placement conventions), update `FOLDER_STRUCTURE_SPEC.md` so it stays accurate
